# SM64Plus

SM64Plus is a fork of [sm64-port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port) that focuses on customizability and aims to add features that not only fix some of the issues found in the base game but also enhance the gameplay overall with extra options.

These features include (but not limited to):
- More responsive controls
- Improved camera
- Extended moveset
- The ability to continue the level after getting a star
- Optional extra modes
- 60FPS support via interpolation
- Various bug fixes

This repo does **not** include all the assets necessary for compiling the game. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets. Binaries of the game itself will **not** be distributed for this very reason.

You can also build the game manually if you prefer to do so, or if you're not on a Windows platform. To do that, follow the instructions from the [Manual Building](https://github.com/MorsGames/sm64plus/wiki/Manual-Building-Guide) page.

On non-Windows platforms, you can pass the path to the `gfx` directory as the first argument to the executable; by default it's generated at `build/us_pc/gfx`.
